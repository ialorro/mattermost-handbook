## How to review a Vendor Invoice

If you need to review an invoice, Accrualify will send you an email alerting you that an invoice is on your queue for review and approval. The email will include the link “Review Invoice Request”, which will direct you to the invoice that needs your attention.

Once you are directed to the pending invoice, please review the following details, such as:
1. Vendor - Please make sure you are reviewing an invoice for the vendor that you have submitted a PO for
2. Amount - Please make sure the amount on the invoice matches the PO submitted
3. Department - Please make sure the department this spend is going to is your department or is properly allocated to your department if the spend is shared with other departments
4. Description - Please make sure the description on the invoice is accurate (for example, it describes the service performed by the vendor for Mattermost)

Once you have reviewed the invoice and are ready to approve, click “Approve and Next”. After you “Approve” the invoice, a Confirmation will pop up to ask “Are you sure you want to approve (invoice xxx)?”, Click “Ok”.

If you need to reject the invoice, click “Reject and Next”. If you reject the invoice, it means you disagree with one or more items on the invoice. When you reject the invoice, please provide the reasons for the reject in the free text box that appears after you click on “Reject and Next”.
