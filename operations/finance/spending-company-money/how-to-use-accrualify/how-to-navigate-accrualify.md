In the Vendor Module, you'll see the list of vendors that Mattermost purchases from. To search for vendors, you can type the name of the vendor in the text box. To add columns for other information, click on the green plus sign to bring down the columns menu. From here you are able to add additional columns on the grid, such as **ID**, **Account manager**, and **Terms**.

In the Credit memos module, you will also be able to see any credit memos that would need to be applied to an invoice. This would probably not happen too often.

At this point in time, you will not need to use the Accruals module and the Corporate Cards module.
