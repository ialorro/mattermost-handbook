Once you're directed to the pending vendor invoice, please review the following details:

1. **Vendor:** Please make sure you are reviewing an invoice for the vendor that you have submitted a PO for.
2. **Amount:** Please make sure the amount on the invoice matches the PO submitted.
3. **Department:** Please make sure the department this spend is going to is your department or is properly allocated to your department if the spend is shared with other departments.
4. **Description:** Please make sure the description on the invoice is accurate (for example, it describes the service performed by the vendor for Mattermost).
