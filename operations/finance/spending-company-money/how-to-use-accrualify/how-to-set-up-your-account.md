## How to set up your account

The Finance team will send you a Welcome email from Accrualify if you need to do any of the following:

* Submit a purchase order
* Review a purchase order
* Review a vendor invoice

If you need to submit a purchase order, please make sure you've submitted a [budget request](https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/finance/spending-company-money/budget). Once your budget request has been approved, the Finance team will provision you an account on Accrualify. You should receive a “Welcome to Accrualify” email, which includes a link to set up your account.
